# Loan Shark (Loan Eligibility Predictor)
🚀 Developed a machine learning model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict loan eligibility, achieving 82% accuracy on test data.

🌟 Input features: Include factors such as income, credit score, employment status, age, marital status & loan amount.

📊 Output: Predicted loan eligibility (e.g., binary output: eligible/not eligible).

🔗 SVM Classifier: Support Vector Machines (SVM) are effective for binary classification tasks like loan eligibility prediction.

🚀 Advantages: SVMs are robust in handling high-dimensional data, effective in cases where the data is not linearly separable through kernel tricks, and can generalize well with appropriate regularization.

📚 Training: The model would be trained on a dataset of labeled examples, where loan eligibility (e.g., yes/no) is known based on historical data.

🛠️ Technologies: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
